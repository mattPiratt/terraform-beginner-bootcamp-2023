The Dark Knight, also known as Batman, is like that one friend who shows 
up at parties in an impeccable costume but insists on brooding in the corner. 
With more gadgets than your average tech store and a knack for disappearing 
when you least expect it, he's the hero Gotham deserves but maybe not 
the one it needs right now. And let's not forget, his arch-nemesis, 
the Joker, gives new meaning to the phrase "Why so serious?" It's a 
never-ending battle of capes, makeup, and wild plans â€“ all in a day's 
work for the Dark Knight!
